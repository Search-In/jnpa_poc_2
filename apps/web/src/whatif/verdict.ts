/**
 * The one-sentence answer.
 *
 * A what-if result currently opens with a table of eighteen figures. An operator
 * who is not a port planner reads that as "here is some data", not as "here is
 * what happens". Every scenario therefore leads with a single plain sentence that
 * states the outcome, and the figures follow underneath for anyone who wants to
 * check it.
 *
 * Rules this file follows:
 *
 * - **No jargon.** "the gate absorbs the extra load", not "gate_absorbs_load: true".
 * - **A number and a consequence**, never a number alone. "563 trucks queued and
 *   six hours to clear" beats "peak_queue: 563.6".
 * - **Say when you cannot answer.** A refusal is a legitimate verdict and gets the
 *   same treatment as a result, so the reader is never left inferring from a blank
 *   panel.
 * - **Pure.** No React, no fetch, no formatting library. It takes the result
 *   envelope and returns strings, so it is trivially testable and portable to the
 *   UC-1 and UC-2 dashboards unchanged.
 *
 * SHARED FILE — the canonical copy lives in jnpa-uc3-poc. UC-1 (poc_1) and UC-2
 * (PoC_2) hold copies so all three dashboards word the same answer identically.
 * Change it here first.
